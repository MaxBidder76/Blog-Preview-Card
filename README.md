## My process

I first of all colored the backgroung. Then used the div tag to create a white background section where the rest of the content are arranged. I imported the image next and gave it the box shadow tag and the arranged and colored all the texts with their respective tags and colors.
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

I learnt how to use the span element to design a particular text in the midst of other elements. Also mastered making my designs mobile sensitive.

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
The <div> tag
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
border redius element

### Continued development

I need to improve more on importing font-family and image positioning as well.

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://www.w3schools.com/css/tryit.asp?filename=trycss_vertical-align) - This is used to position images on texts. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
